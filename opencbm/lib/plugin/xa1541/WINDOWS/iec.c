/*! \internal \brief Start fast scheduling

 The cbm4win driver is very timing sensitive. Because of this, it is
 very important that the scheduling is done as fast as possible.

 Unfortunately, Windows has a varying scheduling granularity. Normally,
 it is in the order of 5 us to 20 us, but it can even grow much larger,
 for example, on an NT4 system or an an SMP or HT machine.

 fastschedule_start() uses a function from mmsystem.h which tells
 Windows to schedule with a much lower granularity. In this case, we ask
 Windows to use a granularity of 1 us.

 Note that this has a negative impact on the overall performance of the
 system, as more scheduling decisions have to be taken by the system.
 Anyway, it has a very positive impact for cbm4win.
 
 Note: Every call to fastschedule_start() has to be balanced with an
 appropriate call to fastschedule_stop()

 \param Release
   The mask of which lines should be released. This has to be a bitwise
   OR between the constants IEC_DATA, IEC_CLOCK, IEC_ATN, and IEC_RESET

 If cbm_driver_open() did not succeed, it is illegal to 
 call this function.

 \bug
   This function can't signal an error, thus, be careful!

 \remark
   If a bit is specified in the Set as well as in the Release mask, the
   effect is undefined.

 This function waits for a line to enter a specific state
 on the IEC serial bus.

 \param HandleDevice
   A CBM_FILE which contains the file handle of the driver.

 \param Line
   The line to be deactivated. This must be exactly one of
   IEC_DATA, IEC_CLOCK, IEC_ATN, and IEC_RESET.

 \param State
   If zero, then wait for this line to be deactivated. \n
   If not zero, then wait for this line to be activated.

   The state of the IEC bus on return (like cbm_iec_poll).

 If cbm_driver_open() did not succeed, it is illegal to
