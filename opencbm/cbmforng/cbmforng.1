.SH NAME
cbmforng \- fast low-level disk formatter for CBM drives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cbmforng
.RI [ options ]
.I drive
.IR name , ID
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cbmforng
is a fast and reliable low-level disk formatter for the 1541 and
compatible devices (1570, 1571, third-party clones).
It was based on
.B cbmformat
and is designed to become the designated successor to
.B cbmformat,
therefore its name: CBM-Formatter, the Next Generation.
.PP
.B cbmforng
does not support a 1581 drive.
.PP
Because this is the first official release of
.B cbmforng
and because it was not used in the field by a wider user group, it still
contains additional measurement routines and informational output after
the formatting process was done.
When
.B cbmforng
proved its matureness and got back some features currently missing
(progress bar), it will replace
.B cbmformat.
.PP
To date
.B cbmforng
should be considered as the more reliable formatter of both; whenever
you should encounter any difficulties with
.BR cbmformat ,
go for
.BR cbmforng .
If you like additional informational messages like e.g. the RPM value
each formatted track was measured, then
.B cbmforng
is the tool you want to use.
Your feedback helps us to decide, if this additional output which was
needed for developing may find its way into future releases.
.PP
.I drive
has to be the drive number of the disk drive,
.I name
is a name with up to 16 characters which will be the name of the disk
after formatting,
.I ID
is the 2-letter disk ID.
.PP
Note: Unlike the N0 command of the drive, the ID must be given (thus,
no so-called "short format" is possible).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-clear\fP
Clear (demagnetize) this disk.
This is highly recommended if the disk is used for the first time, or if
it was previously formatted for another system (i.e., MS-DOS).
Note that this option takes much time.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-no\-bump\fP
Do not bump drive head at the beginning.
Don't use this on eventually misaligned drives.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-original\fP
Fill sectors with the original pattern (0x4b, 0x01, 0x01...) instead
of zeroes.
The original pattern is probably due to a bug in the drive ROM, apart
from this, zeroing out unused sectors should give (slightly) better
results for compressed disk images.
.IP ""
In comparison to
.BR cbmformat ,
the pattern used with
.B cbmforng
is a little bit more original than the one from its predecessor.
On track one the pattern consists of: 0x00, 0x01, 0x01, ... instead of
the first byte beeing 0x4b.
This perfectly reflects the original 1541 ROM format bug.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-retries\fP \fIn\fP
Set the maximum number of retries on errors.
This accounts for all errors that may happen when formatting all the
tracks of the whole disk.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-status\fP
In addition to the informational output of internal values from the
formatting process, the drive status is displayed.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verify\fP
Verify each track after it is written.
As this needs an extra round of the drive for each track, the formatting
time is almost doubled.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-extended\fP
Format a 40 track disk, the BAM format is compatible to SpeedDOS.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Display help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Display version information and exit.
.SH NOTES
We encountered rare failures with decent revision/mechanics combinations
of the 1571 disk drives when using
.BR cbmforng .
We highly recommend to use
.B \-\-original
and
.B \-\-verify
with 1571 drives.
From our experience, with
.BR \-\-original ,
the problem does not occur; with
.BR \-\-verify ,
the drive tests each track after it was formatted and ensures that the
failure condition did not occur; otherwise the same track is formatted
again, as often as the currently set retry value allows.
.PP
We did not encounter these problems with either of 1541 (1541-II, 1541C),
1570 or 1571CR (the drive which is part of the C128DCR) drives, only with
original 1571 drives.
.PP
In the current state,
.B cbmforng
is not able to format double-sided disks on a 1571 drive.
.SH EXAMPLES
Format standard disk (35 tracks) in drive 8:
.RS
.PP
cbmforng 8 GAMES,42
.RE
.PP
Format standard disk (35 tracks) in drive 9, use (buggy) 1541 sector
pattern (for example, because this is a 1571 drive), show drive status
when done:
.RS
.PP
cbmforng \-os 9 1571disk,71
.RE
.PP
SpeedDOS disk (40 tracks), verify formatted tracks, all sectors zeroed
out, no head banging:
.RS
.PP
cbmforng \-nvx 8 "40 TRACKS,OK"
