              README for opencbm/cbm4linux 0.4.3
              ----------------------------------

This README is not maintained separately, but has been integrated
into the main opencbm documentation, which can be found in the
docs/ directory.

Either built it yourself:

  cd docs/
  make -f LINUX/Makefile

or have a look at the online version at

  http://opencbm.trikaliotis.net/

The documentation comes in ASCII, DVI, HTML and Texinfo. If you have the
GNU info program installed you can access the latter one with

  info opencbm

or

  info opencbm.info (if you are in the docs/ directory)

or have a look at the online version

http://opencbm.trikaliotis.net/


Have fun,
Michael Klein <nip@c64.org>
Spiro Trikaliotis.
